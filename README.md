## Description

This is a personal project I made during my first year of my degree in Software Development, which was actually deployed and used for my wedding in 2022. I used this repo for a (very basic) automated deployment, but kept it up as a showcase of my capabilities I had at the time, and as a milestone in my progression as a software developer.

I made some minor tweaks and removed personal information since then.
